# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project Title:** Real-Time Sentiment-Driven Stock Prediction Platform  

**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** [Your Name / Team]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  

---

## 1. Overview
This project aims to build a **real-time stock prediction platform** that leverages **sentiment analysis of news and social media** combined with **historical price data** to forecast stock price movements and volatility. Users will be able to select stocks of interest, monitor sentiment trends, and view predictive insights through a web dashboard.  

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Investors face overwhelming amounts of unstructured information (news, social media posts, online discussions) that significantly impact market sentiment and, consequently, stock prices. Existing platforms provide either delayed insights or limited sentiment analysis. There is a clear need for a **real-time, AI-driven solution** that processes diverse data sources and predicts market trends effectively.  

---

## 3. Goals & Objectives
- Provide **real-time sentiment analysis** of stock-related content from multiple online sources.  
- Combine **sentiment data with historical stock prices** for predictive modeling.  
- Forecast **short-term stock price direction** (up/down) and **volatility levels**.  
- Deliver predictions and insights through a **user-friendly web application**.  
- Ensure scalability to handle multiple stocks and high-frequency data streams.  

---

## 4. Scope
### In Scope
- Web scraping from news, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook.  
- Sentiment classification using pre-trained NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT).  
- Time-series modeling with LSTM or Transformers on combined sentiment and market data.  
- Real-time data pipeline for continuous updates.  
- User dashboard for stock monitoring, sentiment trends, and predictions.  

### Out of Scope (for v1.0)
- Multi-language sentiment support (focus on English first).  
- Complex portfolio optimization or automated trading execution.  
- Advanced financial modeling beyond volatility and direction prediction.  

---

## 5. Users & Personas
- **Retail Investors:** Want simple insights on whether a stock is trending positively or negatively.  
- **Day Traders:** Require near real-time sentiment updates and volatility predictions.  
- **Financial Analysts:** Use the platform for research support and trend validation.  

---

## 6. User Stories
- As a **user**, I want to select a stock so I can monitor sentiment and predictions for it.  
- As a **user**, I want to see the latest sentiment breakdown (positive, neutral, negative) from news and social media.  
- As a **user**, I want to view predicted stock movement (up/down) and volatility levels.  
- As a **user**, I want to see sentiment and prediction trends over time in chart form.  
- As an **admin**, I want to manage scraping schedules and system health.

## 7. System Architecture
### Data Pipeline
1. **Scraping Layer**  
   - Playwright for scraping news & social media.  
   - Scheduler for periodic/real-time jobs.  

2. **Processing Layer**  
   - NLP sentiment classification (BERT-family models).  
   - Entity recognition to link posts/articles to correct stock symbols.  

3. **Prediction Layer**  
   - Combine sentiment signals with historical stock price data.  
   - Time-series models (LSTM / Transformers).  
   - Store results in database.  

4. **Application Layer**  
   - Backend API (Flask/Django/FastAPI or Node.js).  
   - Frontend dashboard (React/Vue).  

---

## 8. Tech Stack
- **Scraping:** Playwright, BeautifulSoup, Tweepy (Twitter API fallback).  
- **NLP:** Python (Hugging Face Transformers: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT).  
- **Prediction:** TensorFlow/PyTorch (LSTM, Transformer models).  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for storing data & predictions).  
- **Backend:** Flask/FastAPI (Python) or Node.js/Express.  
- **Frontend:** React (charts, real-time updates).  
- **Deployment:** Docker + Kubernetes, hosted on AWS/GCP/Azure.  

---

## 9. Evaluation Metrics
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Accuracy, F1-score vs. labeled datasets.  
- **Prediction Model:**  
  - Direction Accuracy (% correct up/down predictions).  
  - Volatility Prediction RMSE/MAE.  
  - Backtesting Sharpe Ratio (profitability measure).  
- **System Performance:** Latency of updates, scraping success rate, API response time.  

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Data Availability Risk:** Social media APIs restrict access → Mitigation: use scraping fallback.  
- **Model Overfitting Risk:** Stock prediction is noisy → Mitigation: regular retraining, cross-validation, backtesting.  
- **Scalability Risk:** Large volumes of real-time data → Mitigation: cloud scaling and message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ).  
- **Regulatory Risk:** Financial advice compliance → Mitigation: disclaimers, insights as “informational only.”  

---

## 11. Milestones & Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Data scraping pipeline (news + Twitter).  
- **Phase 2:** Sentiment model integration (fine-tuned BERT).  
- **Phase 3:** Historical price + sentiment fusion model (LSTM).  
- **Phase 4:** Web dashboard (React + backend API).  
- **Phase 5:** Real-time pipeline integration & deployment.  
- **Phase 6:** Backtesting and performance evaluation.  

---

## 12. Success Criteria
- Functional real-time scraping and sentiment analysis for at least 5 stocks.  
- Achieve >70% accuracy on sentiment classification.  
- Prediction model direction accuracy exceeds 55% baseline.  
- Dashboard provides real-time visualization of sentiment & predictions with <5s refresh latency.
